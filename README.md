In this code, a convolutional neural network <strong>(CNN)</strong> is constructed utilizing the <strong>TensorFlow</strong> library. The purpose of this neural network is to categorize brain <strong>MRI</strong> scans of Alzheimer’s disease <strong>(AD)</strong> patients, distinguishing between AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment <strong>(MCI)</strong>.<br>
The data were first called from <strong>Kaggle</strong>, and then data augmentation was performed on them with the techniques described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-05799-w" target="_blank">"A CNN based framework for classification of Alzheimer’s disease"</a> to augmentation the volume of data to 5 times. Then, images have been classified using these data and the network described in this article. In other words, this code is a simulation of parts of the article.<br>
<strong>TensorFlow/Keras</strong> and <strong>scikit-learn</strong> libraries are used in this code.<br>
